    If you have possible or confirmed COVID-19:
    Stay home except to get medical care.
    Monitor your symptoms carefully. If your symptoms get worse, call your healthcare provider immediately.
    Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
    If you have a medical appointment, notify your healthcare provider ahead of time that you have or may have COVID-19.
    Stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. If possible, use a separate bathroom. If you must be around others, wear a mask.</h4>
   
    <h4>Treatments used for COVID-19 should be prescribed by your healthcare provider. People have been seriously harmed and even died after taking products not approved for COVID-19, even products approved or prescribed for other uses. Your healthcare provider will decide on what approach to take for your treatment.
        Your healthcare provider also may recommend the following to relieve symptoms and support your bodyâ€™s natural defenses.
        Taking medications, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever.
        Drinking water or receiving intravenous fluids to stay hydrated.
        Getting plenty of rest to help the body fight the virus.</h4>
